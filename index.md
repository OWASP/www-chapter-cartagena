## OWASP Cartagena Chapter - Colombia

Cartagena is a city located on the northern coast of Colombia in South America, in the Caribbean Coast Region. Due to its location, it's one of the major ports of the country and it's the capital of the Department of Bol√≠var. In 1984, the colonial walled city and fortress were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Cartagena has several universities and industries that can sponsor the OWASP Community activities. The leaders and collaborators of this chapter are committed to bringing the OWASP message to the entire community of the city and thus ensuring that the security of applications and services is part of the DNA of the industry and the academy.
